I also have experience with Bootstrap 4, Axios and JSON. I have very strong OOP skills and I have worked within the agile methodology.

        </p>
        <p>
            I have worked in a variety of fields and I understand the needs of various types of businesses. I love working with people and greatly value team effort, however I am also self sufficient and motivated. No matter how challenging the task, I will accomplish it. Thoroughly. Precisely. Most importantly, I will create a product that truly meets the customer's needs.
